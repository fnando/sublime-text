All Autocomplete Sublime Text
===========================================================

Extends the default autocomplete to find matches in all open files.

By default Sublime only considers words found in the current file.


Install
-------

If you have Package Control installed in Sublime just press ctrl+shift+p (Windows, Linux) or cmd+shift+p (OS X) to open the Command Pallete.
Start typing 'install' to select 'Package Control: Install Package', then search for AllAutocomplete and select it. That's it.

You can also install this package manually by entering the Packages directory of Sublime Text 2 and issuing on a terminal:
    
    git clone https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete
